        14.17 (Painting) Create a painting application that allows the you to create art by clicking and dragging the mouse across the canvas. Include options for changing the drawing color and line thickness. Provide red, green and blue sliders that allow you to select the RGB color. Include a color swatch below the three sliders so that as you move each slider, the color swatch shows you the cur- rent drawing color. Provide a line-width dialog with a single slider that controls the thickness of the line that youâ€™ll draw. Also include options that allow you to turn the cursor into an eraser, to clear the screen and to save the current drawing. At any point, you should be able to clear the entire draw- ing from the canvas.
